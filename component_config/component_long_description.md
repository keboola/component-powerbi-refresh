The primary purpose of the Power BI Refresh application is to refresh the configured datasets within a Power BI workspace.

**Important:** Each Power BI Refresh configuration can only work with a single Power BI workspace. If you need to refresh datasets in multiple Power BI workspaces, you must create a separate configuration for each workspace.
